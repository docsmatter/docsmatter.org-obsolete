My name is Vladimir Likhanov. I'm a translation manager, CCMS (Component Content Management Systems) administrator, and technical writer with over 18 years of professional experience in creating software documentation. I love researching new technologies, finding their best use cases, and turning them into useful information sources for end users and developers.

In my current position, I work with the software and QA engineers to plan, develop, and write various documentation for complex IT projects in English and German.
I’m responsible for creating and maintaining the company's online help, user and administrator manuals as well as installation guides, system requirements, release notes, and API documentation.

## About technologies behind this website

This website was built using the Hugo static site generator. For storing and delivering the site’s static content, Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3) and Amazon CloudFront (CDN) are used.

The source content is created in Markdown, a lightweight markup language that can be written with any plain-text editor. As an editor, we use Visual Studio Code providing support for Markdown text out of the box.

All source files are stored in a local Git repository. At regular intervals, the content is pushed to a remote repository on GitHub. The repository on GitHub is integrated with Travis CI that takes care of continuous integration and delivery (CI / CD).
