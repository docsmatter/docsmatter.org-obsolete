> This post opens a series of blog posts dedicated to TechSmith Camtasia 2021, one of the most popular screen recorders and video editors.

Camtasia is designed for recording videos from your monitor screen and editing the recorded videos. Using this application, you can create interactive clips, online courses, and much more. You can record the whole screen as well as its individual areas.

Camtasia records all mouse and keyboard actions on the screen. If necessary, you can also record your webcam and voice.

You can edit recorded videos by adding various visual and sound effects to them. Once you are done with editing, the videos can be exported in various formats (MP4, AVI, MOV, etc.) or uploaded directly to your YouTube channel.

## What you'll need

To perform the exercises described in the subsequent posts, you will need:

* **Computer** with Windows 10. For more information about system versions, see the manufacturer’s website.
* **Camtasia** 2021. All the examples in the book are made in Camtasia for Windows 2021. If you are using another version of the program, some of the described features may differ from the features available in your version of the program. The following chapter provides details on how to download the program from the TechSmith website and install it on your computer.
* **Microphone for voice recording**. We are going to make a video with voiceover, i.e. to accompany the actions performed on the monitor screen with voice comments. To record the voice, you can use a built-in microphone (such as a microphone in your laptop) or an external microphone. As a rule, built-in microphones are mostly used for communication on the Internet and do not provide proper sound quality. To create high-quality videos, it is recommended to use an external microphone.
* **Prior knowledge**. We assume that you have experience with the Microsoft Windows operating system, that is, you know how to run programs, save files, and perform other basic operations. Experience with Camtasia or other video editors is not required.

## What you'll get

To get familiar with the Camtasia basic features, we will create a video (screencast) describing how to use the Microsoft Edge browser. As we go through the material, we will edit the video, add various effects to it, and then export it to a special video format that can be viewed on your local computer or uploaded to various video hosting sites (such as YouTube).

## Course structure

The material in this course is given in the sequence that is usually used when creating standard projects in Camtasia, and namely:

* Installing and configuring Camtasia
* Recording and dubbing a screencast
* Editing the screencast and adding effects to it
* Exporting the screencast to MP4 format and uploading it to YouTube

If necessary, you can skip some of the steps above (for example, if you already have Camtasia installed or have already a recorded screencast) and go directly to the chapter you are interested in.

You can also use the book as a reference when creating your own projects, referring to one or another chapter that describes how to work with the re-quired functions.
