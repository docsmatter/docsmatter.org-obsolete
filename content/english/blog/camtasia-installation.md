Camtasia is a commercial software product developed by the TechSmith company. To work with the program, you need
to buy a license and activate it after installation.

Before purchasing Camtasia, you can download a trial version of the program to test all available features and
functions. The trial version is valid for 30 days, after which you will need to install a license to continue
working with the program.

> Note: Creating an account for the trial version
To use the trial version of Camtasia, you must create an account on the TechSmith website. When creating an account,
provide a valid email address and a password. You can do this after installing the program.
