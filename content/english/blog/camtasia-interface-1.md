> In this post, you'll learn about the Camtasia interface and its main features.

Once you've selected an existing project or created a new one in Camtasia, the main
program window opens in which you can perform all the basic operations. The window is
divided into four areas.

![Camtasia - main window](/images/blog/camtasia-main-window.png)

* 1: Menu
* 2: Tabs
* 3: Preview area
* 4: Timeline

The areas are described in more detail in the following sections.

> **Editor and recorder** <br />
The Camtasia application includes two modules: the recorder and the editor. This chapter
describes the editor user interface. Detailed information about the recorder will be given
in the chapter on recording a screencast.

## Menu

The menu is located at the top of the window. It provides access to all the functions
available in Camtasia. Working with the menu in Camtasia is similar to working with
menus in other programs, such as Microsoft Word. You execute a command by clicking on
the corresponding entry in the menu.

Some commands can also be called with a certain keyboard shortcut (e.g. Ctrl + O to open
an existing project).

If a menu command displays a triangular arrow, you can open a submenu with additional
commands by moving the cursor to the command or to the triangular arrow.

Directly below the menu bar is the **Record** button for starting the recorder, buttons for
working with previews, a button for downloading additional resources from the TechSmith website,
and a button for exporting finished videos.

* 1: Record button
* 2: Button for working with the preview area
* 3: Loading additional resources
* 4: Exporting finished videos

## Tabs

The tab area (tab bar) is subdivided into two sub areas: the tab bar and the tab contents. The
selected tab determines the content displayed in the tab area. By default, when you create a new
project or open an existing one, the tab area shows the **Media Bin** with the available clips.

To see all the tabs, click the **More** button.

When you select a feature in the **More** section, it replaces the lowest displayed feature in the
tab bar. For example, once you click on **Voice Narration**, this feature is placed in the tab bar
instead of the **Cursor Effects** feature, and the **Cursor Effects** feature is removed from the
**More** section.
