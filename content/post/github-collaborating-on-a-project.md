> This post provides information on how to collaborate on a project in GitHub using the
so-called [fork and pull model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fork_and_pull_model).

## Prerequisites

In the following, we assume that you have successfully performed all preparatory steps:

* Installed and configured Git on your local computer.
* Created an account in GitHub.
* Set up authentication to GitHub from Git.
* Checked that you can access the repository you want to collaborate on and that the owner
of this repository permits forking.

## Configuration steps

The workflow in the fork and pull model includes completing the following steps:

1. Logging in to your GitHub user account.

2. Navigating to the (original) repository you want to collaborate on.

3. Forking the repository to your user account. By forking, you create a copy of this repository
that you can manage. You can make changes to your fork without affecting the original repository.
To create a fork, click the **Fork** button in the top-right corner of the project's page.

4. Creating a local clone of your fork by following the steps below:

* Navigate to your fork in GitHub.
* Click on the green **Code** button.
* In the opened window, make sure that the **HTTPS** tab is selected and click on the copy icon.

* In Git Bash (or another Git client), go to the directory to which you want to clone the repository.
* Enter the following command and press Enter:

        ~> git clone https://github.com/[YOUR-USERNAME]/[YOUR-FORK-NAME]

5. Configure Git to sync your fork with the original repository:

        ~> git remote add upstream https://github.com/[REPOSITORY-OWNER-USERNAME]/[ORIGINAL-REPOSITORY-NAME]

6. Check that the remote (*upstream*) repository has been successfully configured for your fork:

        ~> git remote -v
        origin  https://github.com/[YOUR-USERNAME]/[YOUR-FORK-NAME] (fetch)
        origin  https://github.com/[YOUR-USERNAME]/[YOUR-FORK-NAME] (push)
        upstream        https://github.com/[REPOSITORY-OWNER-USERNAME]/[ORIGINAL-REPOSITORY-NAME] (fetch)
        upstream        https://github.com/[REPOSITORY-OWNER-USERNAME]/[ORIGINAL-REPOSITORY-NAME] (push)

## Collaborating on the original repository

After you've performed the configuration steps above, you can start collaborating on the original repository.
As a rule, your workflow will look like the following:

1. Checking the upstream branch for updates:

        ~> git fetch upstream

2. Checking out your fork's local default branch:

        ~> git checkout main

3. Merging the changes from the upstream default branch:

        ~> git merge upstream/main

4. Making the desired changes to the content (e.g., creating a new blog post).

5. Committing your changes to the local Git repository and then pushing them to 

5. Pushing the changes to the owner’s repository on GitHub:

        ~> git push origin main

6. Creating a pull request on GitHub from the fork.

After that, the owner of the original repository can review and approve your pull request, thus merging your
changes to the original project.
