> In this post, you'll know how to configure your Azure endpoint for use with a custom domain.

If you are interested in how to set up Microsoft Azure to host your static website, see [Microsoft Azure - hosting a static website]
(/post/ms-azure-static-site-setup.md).

To set up a custom domain for use with an endpoint in Microsoft Azure, you need to create a CNAME record with your DNS provider.
This recourd must point to your endpoint. The procecure slightly differs depending on your DNS provider.

but you need to first add a CNAME that points to the address of the static website generated by the Blob Storage through your DNS provider. Once this CNAME is created, go to the Azure portal, on the Storage Account and find the option "Custom Domain". From there you can add the domain name in such a way that the Storage Account allows connections from this domain name.

You can configure a custom domain with a static website by using Azure Content Delivery Network (Azure CDN). Azure CDN provides consistent low latencies to your website from anywhere in the world.

Azure Content Delivery Network offers a global solution for rapidly delivering content.

These are steps you'll need to complete:

* Creating a CDN profile
* Adding a custom domain to Azure
* Creating a CNAME record with your DNS provider

## Creating a CDN profile

First, you need to create a CDN profile:

1. Go to the **Home** page of your Azure account.

2. Enter **CDN** in the **Search** field.

* The **Front Door and CDN profiles** entry is displayed as one of the offered search results.

5. Accept the default choices by clicking on the **Continue to create a Front Door** button at the bottom of the page.

* The **Create a Front Door profile** page opens.

6. Fill out the following fields:

**Project details**
