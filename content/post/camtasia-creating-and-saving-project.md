> In this post, we'll set up a project for our screencast and configure the central repository for storing all project resources.

[**PREVIOUS POST**](/post/camtasia-recording-screencast/) **< || >** [**NEXT POST**](/post/camtasia-editing-screencast/)

Before starting to edit your screencast, you need to create a new project and add the screencast to it. Projects in Camtasia are used to
work with resources. The main project resources include:

* Video recorded from the monitor screen and/or webcam, as well as system sounds or audio recorded from the microphone. These resources
are stored in a file with the **.trec** extension (**trec** stands for TechSmith Recordings).

* Images (jpeg, png, gif, and so on). As a rule, images in projects are used to create various visual effects.

* Audio (mp3, wav, etc). Audio files can, for example, contain background music or voice-over narration recorded in a third-party
program.

You can create a project separately from the video - that is, an empty project - and then add the desired video and audio files or images to it.
In our case, the screencast was automatically opened in the Camtasia editor and a new project was created for it. Now we need to save it.

1. Choose **Save** from the **File** menu.

    * A window opens where you can specify the folder for storing your project. By default, the **Documents\Camtasia** folder is suggested.
    Let's save the project in the default folder for now.

2. Enter a project name in the **File name** field (for example, **ms-edge-tutorial**).

3. Click the **Save** button.

    * The project is saved in the specified location with the **.camproj** extension (in our case **ms-edge-tutorial.camproj**).

## Configuring the central repository for the project

When you add video, audio, and other resource files to a project, they are not copied to the project folder, but only linked to the project.
Thus, if you delete the source files or move them to another location, they will no longer be available within the project.

For more comfortable work, we'll create a special folder for our project - **MS-Edge-Tutorial** - and move our project file and the recorded screencast
into it. To do this:

1.	If the project is open in Camtasia, close the program.

2.	Create a subfolder named **MS-Edge-Tutorial** in the **Documents\Camtasia** directory.

3.	Move the recorded screencast to the **MS-Edge-Tutorial** subfolder. This file is located in the **Documents\Camtasia** folder and has the name of
**Rec-MM-DD-YY.trec**.

4.	Move the project file to the **MS-Edge-Tutorial** subfolder. Now your subfolder should contain two files.

5.	Double-click the project file.

    * The project containing our screencast is opened in Camtasia.

As a rule, Camtasia automatically finds the screencast if it is located in the same folder as the project file.
If for some reason the screencast can't be found, a window is shown where you can select the new file location.

![Camtasia - specifying the new location of the project](/images/blog/camtasia-specifying-new-project-location.png)

Click the **Yes** button, then go to the **MS-Edge-Tutorial** subfolder in the window that opens and choose your screencast.
