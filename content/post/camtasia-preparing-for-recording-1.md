> This post walks you through the process of setting everything up for recording a
screencast.

[**PREVIOUS POST**](/post/camtasia-interface-2/)

To learn more about the features of Camtasia, we'll create a screencast. A screencast is a
digital video recording of your monitor screen that can be accompanied by a voice narration.

Before you start recording your screencast, it is recommended that you take a few preparatory
steps. They will help you improve the quality of your video and audio content. Typically,
these steps include setting up the working environment, preparing the application to be recorded,
configuring the recording options, and creating a script.

## Setting up the working environment

First of all, you need to set up the working environment by following the steps below.

* Check that Camtasia is correctly installed on your operating system (Windows or Mac) and 
activated. To do this, simply run Camtasia and check that no errors or activation requirements
are shown.

* Remove all unnecessary shortcuts, files and folders from your desktop. To temporarily hide
all icons, you can right-click in an empty area of the desktop and select **View** - 
**Show desktop icons**. After the recording is complete, you can bring all the icons back by
performing this operation again.

* Change the desktop background from bright/multicolor to neutral/monochrome.

* Check that your microphone works. You can use a USB microphone or headphones with a
microphone to record your voice. Connect the microphone to your computer/laptop and make sure
that it has been correctly recognized by the system.

## Creating the script

Creating a script is one of the most important steps when preparing for a screencast. The script
describes the sequence of steps to perform and the actions that accompany those steps. If you
plan to add a voiceover narration to the screencast, it is also recommended to include a description
of what will be said in the script.

Our screencast will be dedicated to working with the Microsoft Edge browser. To record the screencast,
we'll use the pre-made script that you can download by following this [link](/pdfs/script.pdf) (PDF file).
You can use this script or choose another program for recording and create your own script.

## Starting the screen recorder

To capture images and record screen actions a special recording device - Camtasia Recorder - is used.
You can use one of the following ways to start the recorder:

* Click on **TechSmith** - **Camtasia Recorder 2020** in the Windows main menu.

* Click the **New Recording** button in the Camtasia Welcome window. This method is usually used when
creating a new project.

* Click the **Record** button under the menu bar in the main program window. You can use this method, for example,
when working with an existing project.
