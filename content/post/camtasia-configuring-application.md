> This post describes the final steps you need to complete before starting the recording.

In our screencast, we are going to explain the basics of working with the Microsoft Edge browser.
Before starting the recording, we need to configure the application appropriately. Follow these steps:

1.	If you have not yet configured [the recording area](/post/camtasia-preparing-for-recording-2/),
start the Camtasia Recorder and select **720p HD (1280x720)** in the **Custom** field of the
**Widescreen (16:9)** section.

    * A rectangle bounded by a green dotted line is displayed on the screen

2.	Hover the mouse pointer over the dragging icon of the screen area in the center of the rectangle
(the mouse pointer will turn into a cross) and drag with the left mouse button until the rectangle
is in the center of your screen.

3. If there are any files, folders, or shortcuts within the rectangle on the desktop, move them outside
the rectangle.

4.	Move the Microsoft Edge shortcut to the center of the rectangle. We will use this shortcut in the
recording process to launch the browser. Now your screen should look like this:

5.	Double-click the shortcut to open Microsoft Edge.

6.	Resize the Microsoft Edge window to coincide with the boundaries of the recorded area (rectangle).

7.	Close the Microsoft Edge and the Camtasia Recorder.

Now we are ready to record our screencast.

> **Test Run** <br />
After setting up the Microsoft Edge application, you may wish to execute the steps in the script in test mode, without
activating the recording option. This can help you make sure that you are familiar with all the Microsoft Edge elements
(what they are called, where you can find them, etc.) and that they are all located in the recorded area.
