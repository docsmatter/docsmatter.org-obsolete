## The **Projects** section

Under **Projects**, you can create new translation projects or manage existing ones.

![SDL Trados Studio - the Projects section](/images/blog/sdl-trados-interface-projects.png)

In the navigation pane (1), you can filter projects by status, due date, or type. The central area is divided into two parts:

* The upper part of the area (2) lists the available projects.
* If you select a project in the upper part, you can view various information about it in the lower part of the area (3) by
switching between the tabs (4) **Project Details**, **Confirmation Statistics**, **Analysis Statistics**, **Task History**,
**Project Attributes**.

If you select **Projects**, the ribbon provides access to commands for working with projects. For example, you can create a
new project or change settings for an existing project.

Working with projects will be described in detail in one of the following blog posts.

## The **Files** section

The **Files** section is used for working with project files. All commands for basic file operations are available on the ribbon.
For example, here you can perform the following operations:

* Open files for translation, editing, or approval.
* Add new files to the project or delete unnecessary files from it.
* Open the folder where the file to be translated is stored.

The central area is divided into two parts:

* The upper part (1) lists all the files included in the project.
* After selecting a file in the upper part, in the lower part of the area (2) you can view various information by switching
between the tabs (3) **File Details**, **Analysis Statistics**, **Confirmation Statistics**, **Task History**, and **File Attributes**.

The navigation pane on the left side of the window provides access to the following functions:

* (1) Selecting the file that should be displayed in the central area.
* (2) Selecting the language for which the files should be displayed in the central area.
* (3) Selecting the folder that contains the project files. If the folder contains subfolders, you can also activate the **Include subfolders**
option. In this case, the files in the main folder and all subfolders are displayed in the central area.
* (4) Show your assigned tasks.
* (5) Show tasks assigned by you to other project participants.
