> This post describes how to configure Microsoft Azure to host your static website.

## About static websites

A static website is a site that consists of static HTML pages. It usually contains HTML text, images, and multimedia content
(audio, video, etc.) and can also include some CSS and JavaScript. For more information about static websites, see
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_web_page.

When you create a static site, you get a collection of static assets that you need to upload to a web server to make
your content available to the public. This is where cloud service providers like Microsoft Azure come in. The Blob Storage
service - which is part of Microsoft Azure - allows you to upload your static site files to the cloud and host them there.

These are the steps you need to take to deploy a static website on Microsoft Blob Storage:

* Create a storage account
* Enable static website hosting
* Upload your content to the static site
* Check that your static site is available to the public

> In this article, we assume that you have an active subscription with Microsoft Azure. See https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/
for more information.

## Creating a storage account

In the first step, we need to create a storage account in Microsoft Azure:

1. Sign in to the Azure portal.

2. Click in the search field, enter **Storage accounts**, and press Enter.

* The list of services in Microsoft Azure is displayed.

![Microsoft Azure - searching for Storage Accounts](/images/blog/azure/azure-searching-for-storage-accounts.png)

3. In the **Services** section, click on the **Storage accounts** entry.

* The **Storage accounts** page opens.

![Microsoft Azure - Storage Accounts page](/images/blog/azure/azure-storage-accounts-page.png)

4. Click on the **+ Create** button.

* The **Create a storage account page** opens.

![Microsoft Azure - creating a new storage account](/images/blog/azure/azure-filling-files-for-storage-account.png)

5. Fill in the following fields:

* **Subscription**: Select your Azure subscription.
* **Resource group**: Select the **Website** entry, or create a new resource group with any name you like.
* **Storage account name**: Enter the name for your storage account. This name must be unique across all your storage
accounts. It may contain only numbers and lowercase letters (e.g., *mylocalstorage01*).
* **Region**: Choose the appropriate region for your storage.
* **Performance**: Leave the **Standard** option selected.
* **Redundancy**: Let's take the cheapest **Locally-redundant storage (LRS)** option. You usually host the content
of your static site locally or in some remote repository (e.g., in GitHub) and can quickly re-upload it to Azure if something
goes wrong.

6. Click on the **Review** button at the bottom of the page.

7. Review the made settings and click on the **Create** button.

* The storage service is created.

## Enabling static website hosting

Now we need to enable the **Static website hosting** feature on the storage account because this feature is disabled by
default in Microsoft Azure.

1. Click on your account name (**docucademy** in our example).

* The account overview page opens.

2. In the left navigation, go to the **Data management**  section and click on the **Static website** entry.

![Microsoft Azure - enabling static website hosting](/images/blog/azure/azure-enabling-static-website.png)

3. In the **Static website** section, click on the **Enabled** button.

* The static website feature is enabled.
* Two additional fields are displayed.

4. Enter the following information in the displayed fields:

* **Index document name**: Type in the name of your website's default page (usually **index.html**). The
default index page is displayed when a user navigates to the root of your static website (e.g., *www.example.com*).
* **Error document path**: Type in the name of your website's error page (usually **404.html**). The
default error page is displayed when a user attempts to navigate to a page that does not exist on your static website.

5. Click on the **Save** button.

* Your settings are saved.
* A blob storage container with the name of **$web** is created. This container will store your website files.
* A confirmation message is displayed. Your static website endpoints and other configuration information are shown within the Overview pane.

## Uploading content to the static site

In the next step, you'll upload the content of your static site to the Azure blob storage container:

1. In the left navigation of your storage service, click on **Storage browser** - **Blog containers** - **$web**.

![Microsoft Azure - enabled static website hosting](/images/blog/azure/azure-displaying-web-blob-storage.png)

3. Click on the **Upload** button in the right part of the page.

* The **Upload blob** page opens.

4. Create at least two HTML pages: **index.html** and **404.html**. Just open your favorite text editor and
use the text below to create these two files.

* **index.html**
    
        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
            <head>
                <title>My first page</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <h1>This is my new static website!</h1>
            </body>
        </html>

* **404.html**

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
            <head>
                <title>Error</title>
            </head>
            <body>
                <h1>This is my error page!</h1>
            </body>
        </html>

5. Navigate to your files using the **Browse for files** link.

6. Click on the **Upload** button.

* Your files are uploaded to the **$web** blob storage container.

## Checking your static website

Finally, you can check that the files have been successfully uploaded to Microsoft Azure and can be
accessed on the Internet:

1. Navigate to the **Data management**  section of your storage and click on the **Static website** entry.

2. Copy the URL displayed in the **Primary endpoint** field.

![Microsoft Azure - copying the static site URL](/images/blog/azure/azure-primary-endpoint.png)

3. Enter the copied URL in your browser and press Enter.

* The content of your uploaded **index.html** file should be displayed in the browser window.

4. Append **/404.html** to the URL and click Enter.

* Now the content of the uploaded **404.html** file should be shown.

So, where to go next? You may now wish to set up a custom domain name for your static website or configure
Azure Content Delivery Network (CDN) to deliver your content globally. We'll discuss this in more detail
in one of our next articles.
