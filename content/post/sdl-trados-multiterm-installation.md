Let's now install the SDL MultiTerm application for managing your terminology databases (also
referred to as termbases).

1. Go to the folder with the installation file (usually it's called **SDLMultiTermDesktop2021_XXXXX.exe**)
and double-click on it.

4. We only need to install the SDL MultiTerm application itself. Activate the **SDL MultiTerm 2021** option and click
**Next**.

> **SDL MultiTerm Convert and SDL MultiTerm Widget** <br />
SDL MultiTerm Convert is used to convert terminology databases of different formats (TBX, Excel, etc.) into a format
supported by SDL MultiTerm.
The SDL MultiTerm Widget is a desktop widget that allows you to view the meaning of terms.
Working with SDL MultiTerm Convert and SDL MultiTerm Widget is not covered in this book.

* A window opens where you can select the folder for installing MultiTerm.
