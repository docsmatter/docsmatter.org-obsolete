> In this post, you'll learn how to activate your Camtasia installation.

After registering on the TechSmith website / activating the program, the welcome screen opens.

![Camtasia - Welcome window](/images/blog/camtasia-welcome-window.png)

If you are running the evaluation version, a window is displayed with information about the remaining
time for using the program. Close it by clicking on the **X**, or click the **Continue Trial** button.

In the welcome screen, the functions that are most often used in the program are available:

* **New Project**. Click this button to create a new project.
* **New Recording**. This button opens the window with settings for recording.
* **Open Project**. Use this button to open an existing project.
* **New From Template**. By clicking this button, you can create a new project based on an existing template.

The right side of the window lists the last projects you worked on. Double-clicking on a project opens it
in the edit window.

In addition, the welcome window provides access to various Camtasia tutorials on the TechSmith website.
Here you can watch different video tutorials (**Video Tutorials**) and webinars (**Webinars**) or take
one of the small courses at the Camtasia Academy (**Academy**). Note that all materials are in English.

If you do not want this window to be shown every time you start the program, deactivate the **Show on launch**
option. You can reactivate the option of displaying the welcome window by clicking the **Show Welcome Window**
option on the **Help** menu and activating the respecting box in the opened window.
