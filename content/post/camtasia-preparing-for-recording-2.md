> In this post, we continue exploring the process of setting everything up for recording a
screencast.

## Configuring reporting options

Camtasia Recorder has a special window for configuring the parameters of your planned recording.
By default, when you run Camtasia Recorder for the first time, the Camtasia Recorder window opens
in the lower right corner of the desktop. If you move the window to another location on the screen,
the next time you start it, it will be displayed in that location.

The window is divided into several areas:

![Camtasia - window with recording settings](/images/blog/camtasia-window-with-recording-settings.png)

* 1: Recording window - main menu
* 2: Settings for configuring the recording area size
* 3: Settings for configuring the recording devices
* 4: Button for starting the recording

In recording mode, the window view changes depending on the selected options.

## Recording window - main menu

The main menu provides access to all functions of the Camtasia Recorder. For example, in the **Tools** - **Options**
menu, you can configure such recording properties as displaying tooltips, using effects, configuring video formats
for saving the recordings, etc.

In the **Tools** - **Recording Toolbars** menu, you can also adjust the Camtasia Recorder window view during recording
by activating/deactivating the desired options.

This, for example, is what the window looks like when recording with the default settings:

![Camtasia - window with the default recording settings](/images/blog/camtasia-default-recording-options.png)

Let's deactivate the **Statistics** and **Effects** options (we won't need them in our recording process). After
deactivating the options our window will look like this:

## Recording area settings

In the **Select area**, you can configure the screen area to record to meet your needs.

You can record the entire desktop using the **Full screen** button. After selecting this mode, a blue dot below this button
indicates that the full mode is activated.

The **Custom** button allows you to select a desired area of the screen for recording. After clicking the button, a rectangle with green dotted lines is shown, defining the recording area. To move the rectangle to the desired location on the screen, hover the mouse pointer over the icon (the mouse pointer then takes the form of a cross) and drag the mouse in the desired direction. To change the size of the recorded area, you can use the square markers on the corners and sides of the rectangle.

![Camtasia - specifying the recording area](/images/blog/camtasia-recording-area.png)

* 1: Square marker
* 2: Icon for moving the recording area

You can also change the dimensions of the recording area by entering the corresponding values in the **Dimensions** field.
If you activate the lock icon to the right of the field, then when you enter a value in one field, the value of the other
field will also automatically change.

Alternatively, you can click on the arrow in the **Custom** field and select one of the pre-configured screen sizes for recording.

![Camtasia - fields for entering the recording area size](/images/blog/camtasia-selecting-preconfigured-screen-size.png)

Pay attention to the **Lock to application** option. When this option is activated, the recording area is locked to the
active window - that is, it takes on the same dimensions as the active application. When you move the active window, the
recording area automatically moves behind it. This mode is convenient to use, for example, if the work is carried out in
any one application.

For our screencast that we will record later on, we will use a high definition video with 720 pixels and an image resolution
of 1280x720. Select **720p HD (1280x720)** in the **Custom** field in the **Widescreen (16:9)** section (see figure the above).
